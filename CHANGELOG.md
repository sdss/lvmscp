# Changelog

## 0.6.13 - November 22, 2023

### ‚ú® Improved

* Added `CALIBFIB` keyword.


## 0.6.12 - November 18, 2023

### ‚ú® Improved

* Bump `archon` to 0.11.5.


## 0.6.11 - November 5, 2023

### ‚ú® Improved

* Use `iers.conf.auto_download = True`. If there is no internet connection the `iers_degraded_accuracy = "ignore"` should not make it fail.


## 0.6.10 - September 14, 2023

### ‚ú® Improved

* Updated `archon` to 0.11.2 with a fix for `wait-for-idle`.


## 0.6.9 - August 31, 2023

### ‚ú® Improved

* Added `V_LVMSCP` header keyword with `lvmscp` version.
* Added `SKYENAME` and `SKYWNAME` to header model.
* Added `POSCIPA`, `POSKYEPA`, and `POSKYWPA` to header model.


## 0.6.8 - August 24, 2023

### ‚ú® Improved

* Added default header keywords for guider and standards.


## 0.6.7 - August 20, 2023

### ‚ú® Improved

* Added local mean sidereal time header keyword ``LMST``. Note that the value is computed without updated ``IERS-B`` tables so it may be slightly off.


## 0.6.6 - August 14, 2023

### ‚ú® Improved

* Added tile pointing keywords.
* Updated `archon` to 0.11.1.


## 0.6.5 - August 11, 2023

### ‚ú® Improved

* [#23](https://github.com/sdss/lvmscp/pull/23) `ln2fill abort` now creates a lockfile in `/data/ln2fill.lock` that, if present, prevents new purges or fills. It can be removed with `ln2fill clear`.
* [#23](https://github.com/sdss/lvmscp/pull/23) By default the pressure of the cryostats is checked before a purge or fill. If any camera is above the threshold the purge/fill is aborted.
* Custom configuration is now merged with the default, internal configuration.
* Clean-up how header keywords are compiled and how defaults are set.


## 0.6.4 - July 27, 2023

### üîß Fixed

* Emit timed status messages as internal and without registering them in the log.


## 0.6.3 - July 26, 2023

### üö® Removed

* Deleted legacy lab code to write log data and Google Sheets

### ‚ú® Improved

* The actor now emits its status on a timer with delay configurable as `status_delay`. With this `cerebro` is not required to ask for the status directly.


## 0.6.2 - July 26, 2023

### ‚ú® Improved

* [#21](https://github.com/sdss/lvmscp/issues/21) Improve how the delegate retries opening/closing the shutter when the first attempt fails. If the shutter fails twice closing, the exposure is read anyway.


## 0.6.1 - July 20, 2023

### ‚ú® Improved

* Added ``SMJD`` header keyword with the SDSS Modified Julian Date.


## 0.6.0 - July 18, 2023

### üîß Fixed

* [#20](https://github.com/sdss/lvmscp/issues/20) Update archon to 0.11 which solves the issue with exposure times being limited to 1000 seconds. Marking this as a minor release because archon 0.11 is a breaking change and requires a major modification to the ACF that is not backwards compatible.


## 0.5.2 - July 17, 2023

### ‚ú® Improved

* Round up telescope values in headers.
* Change `TRIMSEC` and `BIASSEC` header keywords. Fixed incorrect values due to the three prescan pixels and split `TRIMSEC` and `BIASEC` by amplifier.


## 0.5.1 - July 13, 2023

### ‚ú® Improved

* Bump `archon` to 0.10.0 with support for asynchronous readouts.


## 0.5.0 - July 9, 2023

### üöÄ New

* [#16](https://github.com/sdss/lvmscp/pull/16), [#17](https://github.com/sdss/lvmscp/pull/17), [#18](https://github.com/sdss/lvmscp/pull/18) CLI tools to control LN2 fills with camera and vent line purge.
* [DT-4](https://jira.sdss.org/browse/DT-4) Write checksums.

### ‚ú® Improved

* Updated `archon` to `0.9.0`.
* Add telescope and tile headers.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Engineering

* Build Docker image using Python 3.11.


## 0.4.0 - March 4, 2023

### üöÄ New

* Add suport for spectrograph 3.
* Support Python 3.11.

### ‚ú® Improved

* Use `$OBSERVATORY` as spreadsheet location and use different spreadsheets for each spectrograph.
* Support specifying the `lvmieb` actor name. This is useful when `lvmscp` and `lvmieb` are deployed in multiple instances, one per spectrograph.

### üè∑Ô∏è Changed

* Use unbined flushing during idle.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Engineering

* Use `python:3.11-slim-bullseye` base image for Docker image.
* Allow to set the configuration file to use using `$LVMSCP_CONFIG_FILE`.


## 0.3.0 - May 28, 2022

### üî• Breaking changes

* [#3](https://github.com/sdss/lvmscp/pull/3) Many changes, the main ones including:
  * The `lvmscp` actor now inherits from `ArchonActor`. There is no archon actor anymore and archon is only used as a library. This is analogous to how [yao](https://github.com/sdss/yao) works.
  * Removed the `Supervisor` class.
  * `lvmscp` now has all the archon commands, including an updated `expose` command.
  * General code clean-up, linting, testing, etc.

### ‚ú® Improved

* Reading sensor and system data is now done during integration using `ExposureDelegate.expose_cotasks()` instead of during readout, to avoid poetentially out of data information.
* Improved code to retrieve lamp status from the latest version of `lvmnps`.


## 0.1.3 - February 27, 2022

Major updates:

* *The code structure is modulized. The algorizmatic code is all in supervisor.py
* *The focus command was roll backed and the user can also make the API and run the sequence
* *linting, and also minor bugs were fixed.
* *there was a error the the arc lamp was wrongly added on the fits header.


## 0.1.2 - January 17, 2022

Major updates:

* *The cluplus is added for the modulization of the package
* *The focus command was removed since the user can make the API and run the sequence
* *docstrings were added on the functions
* *all of the commands are added on the module.py, so the user can run the API of the
 lvmscp as test.py
